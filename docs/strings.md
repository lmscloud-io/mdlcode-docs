# Managing Language Strings with MDLCode

## Looking Up Strings

When you spot an orange-highlighted identifier, MDLCode has identified a Moodleâ„¢ entity.

### Hover for String Value

Sometimes, you might encounter multiple string values, such as for help elements or strings with conditional concatenation.

### Jump to String Definition

You can Ctrl+Click or right-click and select "Go to definition" from the context menu.

### Detecting Non-Existing String References

MDLCode spots errors in string identifiers and flags them as problems.

## Exploring String References (Premium)

### Finding All References

In the language file (`PLUGINDIR/lang/en/PLUGINNAME.php`), right-click on a string identifier, then select "Find all references", "Go to references", or "Peek > Peek references".

### Identifying Unused Strings

Unused string identifiers in the language file are reported as problems.

If you find any false positive errors,
consider using [directives](directives.md) to fine-tune problem reporting or provide information to MDLCode about existing references.

### Renaming Strings

Right-click a string identifier in the language file and select "Rename symbol". This will update the string and all references to it. Occasionally, references might not auto-update, such as with dynamically generated identifiers or when references come from [directives](directives.md). In such cases, a notification popup will appear.

## Creating New Strings (Premium)

### Generating Missing Strings

Encountering a 'String does not exist' issue? Click on the "Quick fix" link in the
error popup and choose "Create string."

### Converting Text to Language String

Highlight the text you want to convert. In PHP and JS files, it should be enclosed in quotes; in MUSTACHE files, it can be any content except tags and placeholders. Click the yellow lightbulb icon on the left and select "Replace with new string ..."

If an identical language string already exists, you'll also see the option "Replace with existing string ..."

## Sorting Strings Alphabetically (Premium)

Place a mouse cursor on top of any text in the language file, click on the yellow lightbulb on the left and choose "Sort strings alphabetically".

Strings after a "// Deprecated ..." comment won't be sorted.
