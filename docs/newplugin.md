# Creating New Moodleâ„¢ Plugins with MDLCode

To access the "New plugin" wizard:
- Right-click on the desired plugin type within the Plugins view and choose "New plugin", or
- Click on the "New..." button in the Wizard view within the Moodle view container.

This action will lead you to the "New plugin" wizard, where you can specify the plugin's
type, name, and display name.

For the most frequently used plugin types, MDLCode will automatically generate all necessary
files, capabilities, and strings.

For less common plugin types, MDLCode will create only the `version.php` file and the language file. If you're not using the **Premium version of MDLCode**, these two files will be the only ones generated for any plugin type.

When creating a new plugin, you typically won't see any settings. Instead, MDLCode offers autocomplete suggestions, additional Wizard choices, and fills in default content when you create new files.
