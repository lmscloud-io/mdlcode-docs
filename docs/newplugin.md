# Creating new plugin in MDLCode

You can open the "New plugin" wizard:
- right click on the plugin type in the Plugins view and select "New plugin"
- click on "New..." button in the Wizard view in the Moodle view container

You will be taken to the "New plugin" wizard where you can select plugin
type, name and display name.

For the most popular plugin types MDLCode will also create all required
files, capabilities and strings.

For the other plugin types MDLCode will only create `version.php`
and the language file. Also, if you are not using Premium version,
only these two files will be created for any plugin type.

There are usually no options when creating a new plugin, instead MDLCode
provides autocomplete suggestions, other Wizard options, populates default content
when creating new files, and so on.

Check out the [main documentation page](README.md) for other MDLCode functionality.
