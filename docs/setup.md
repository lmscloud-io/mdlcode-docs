# Recommendations on setting up VSCode for Moodle development

**MDLCode extension** can parse PHP and JS files but it does not provide features of a language server.

In order to work with Moodle code you also need to install a **PHP IntelliSense** extension for VSCode,
for example [PHP Devsense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode)
or [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client).

VSCode aleady has built-in support for JavaScript IntelliSense, but you might also want to install [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

There are also quite a few extensions that can help you with syntax highlighting and code formatting in Mustache and Behat feature files, for example
[dawhite.mustache](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dawhite.mustache) and
[stevejpurves.cucumber](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevejpurves.cucumber).
