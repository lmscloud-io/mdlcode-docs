# Recommendations for Setting up VSCode for Moodleâ„¢ Development

To effectively work with Moodle code using the **MDLCode extension**, it's important to note that while MDLCode can parse PHP and JS files, it doesn't provide the full capabilities of a language server.

To enhance your development experience with Moodle, you should consider installing a **PHP IntelliSense** extension for VSCode. Two popular options are [PHP Devsense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode) and [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client).

For JavaScript code, VSCode already offers built-in support for IntelliSense. However, you might find it beneficial to also install [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for better code quality and consistency.

Moreover, there are several extensions available that can assist you with syntax highlighting and code formatting for Mustache and Behat feature files. For example, you can consider using [dawhite.mustache](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dawhite.mustache) for Mustache files and [stevejpurves.cucumber](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevejpurves.cucumber) for Behat feature files.

By setting up your VSCode environment with these extensions, you can enhance your workflow and make your Moodle development tasks more efficient.
